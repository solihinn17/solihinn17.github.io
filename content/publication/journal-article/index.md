abstract: >
  We theoretically investigate the optical absorption of an undoped graphene monolayer embedded in a one-dimensional multilayer dielectric stack with mirror symmetry. Using the transfer matrix method, we derive analytical and numerical solutions for the optical absorption as a function of the stack's structural parameters. We find that in an ABC structure with even repetition number, graphene absorbs 2.3% of light—identical to the value for free-standing graphene. However, in an ABC structure with odd repetition or an ABCD structure (regardless of repetition number), the optical absorption can reach up to 50%, which is the theoretical maximum for undoped monolayers in symmetric stacks. These results enable tunable light absorption between 0–50% and offer design flexibility for optoelectronic applications.

summary: >
  Tunable light absorption in undoped graphene is demonstrated using dielectric multilayer stacks, reaching up to 50% depending on the stack configuration and refractive indices.

This paper investigates tunable optical absorption in undoped graphene using multilayer dielectric stacks with mirror symmetry. The maximum absorption of 50% is theoretically derived and confirmed through analytical and numerical results, depending on layer configuration and refractive index ratios. This tunability opens promising opportunities for optoelectronic device applications.
