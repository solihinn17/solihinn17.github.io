abstract: >
  We theoretically investigate the optical absorption of an undoped graphene monolayer embedded in a one-dimensional multilayer dielectric stack with mirror symmetry. Using the transfer matrix method, we derive analytical and numerical solutions for the optical absorption as a function of the stack's structural parameters. We find that in an ABC structure with even repetition number, graphene absorbs 2.3% of light—identical to the value for free-standing graphene. However, in an ABC structure with odd repetition or an ABCD structure (regardless of repetition number), the optical absorption can reach up to 50%, which is the theoretical maximum for undoped monolayers in symmetric stacks. These results enable tunable light absorption between 0–50% and offer design flexibility for optoelectronic applications.

summary: >
  This work demonstrates tunable light absorption in undoped graphene using dielectric multilayers. Optical absorption can reach up to 50% depending on stack configuration and refractive indices.

In this study, we developed an analytical model and conducted numerical simulations to evaluate the optical absorption in undoped monolayer graphene when placed inside multilayer dielectric stacks with mirror symmetry. The main findings include:

- In ABC structures with even repetition number (r), absorption is fixed at 2.3%.
- In ABC structures with odd r or ABCD structures (any r), absorption reaches up to 50%.
- The absorption is tunable between 0–50% by varying the repetition number and refractive index ratio.
- The peak absorption is strongly correlated with electric field enhancement at the center of the stack.
- The work builds upon previous studies on AB structures and extends the tunability and efficiency of optical design.

This paper introduces a robust approach to controlling light-matter interactions in atomically thin systems and opens new opportunities for designing photodetectors, photovoltaics, and optoelectronic devices using 2D materials.
